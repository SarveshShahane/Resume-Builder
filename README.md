## Known Issues & Contributions Welcome

### 🚧 Major Features Need Development - Help Needed!

This project has several **incomplete features** that require community contributions:

#### 1. PDF Download Feature
- **OKLCH Color Function Errors**: Modern Tailwind CSS color functions (OKLCH) are causing compatibility issues with HTML2Canvas
- **Text Overlap Issues**: Generated PDFs sometimes have overlapping text elements
- **Layout Inconsistencies**: The PDF output doesn't always match the preview layout

#### 2. Preview UI Incomplete
- **Styling Issues**: Preview components need better CSS styling and layout improvements
- **Responsive Design**: Preview area doesn't adapt well to different screen sizes
- **Visual Polish**: Missing professional styling, proper spacing, and typography
- **Layout Bugs**: Some sections don't render correctly in the preview pane
- **Mobile View**: Preview is not optimized for mobile devices

**We welcome contributions to fix these issues!** 

If you have experience with:
- PDF generation in React applications
- HTML2Canvas and jsPDF libraries
